# This has invalid asm generated for its test
# 'foo' gets the argument in edi
# Passes the argument to bar in eax
# 'bar' accepts the argument in edi
# inline asm is incorrect, needs to use =d and d on the value

# Fails even on host device
# 'test_pextrw' does a zero extend to the gpr
# Which means its -3339 value turns in to 0xf2f5
# While the 'compute_correct_result' value does a sign extension
# Which turns the value in to 0xfffff2f5
# This causes its comparison to fail
